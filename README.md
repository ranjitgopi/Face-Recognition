# Face_Recognition
Build a face identification model to recognize human faces from Facial Recognition Dataset collected from Pinterest. This dataset contains 10,770 images for 100 people. All images are taken
from 'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library. We use weights from 'vgg_face_weights.h5' to train the CNN.
